Arctic's Customizable Thirdperson (Weapons) 3.0

You've decompiled this addon, presumably to mod it or learn how to make weapons.

Here are some basic tips:

 - Every position is relative to the base weapon.
 - Use SWEP.NewMuzzleOffset.
 - For a list of everything you can do with the base, look in act3_base/shared.lua.
 - However, the base pack should include examples for practically everything.
 - I don't even know if this'll be up whenever you're reading this, but you can try joining the official Discord server at: https://discord.gg/gaHXusZ
 - ACT3 should be versatile enough to turn weapon prop packs into full, proper weapons.
 - Use the command act3_generatebgs while looking at a prop to automatically create a bodygroup table for any model.
 - I don't use SWEP Creation Kit's format, but it will be useful for lining up weapon parts.
 
I have no real ability to stop you from reuploading/modifying this addon. I do ask that you not do this, however. You should be able to accomplish everything you need without reuploading this.
This is primarily so that I can update this in the future easily.

Put code modules in /act3/mods/server, /client, and /shared to make sure they get loaded after the base files.

If you need anything changed for modding purposes, feel free to ask me.

I hope everyone has as much fun playing with this mod as I had making it! Kept you waiting, huh?
